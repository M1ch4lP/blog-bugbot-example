This rule provides conventions for creation of new fastify plugins representig feature modules:

- Every directory in the `features` represents a feture module that should be a complete Fastify plugin with its own encapsulated scope
- While using `.decorate` method ensure that all custom properties added to Fastify instance have their own type declarations specific to the module

Conventions for feature module services:

- To elevate dependency injection all services should be added using a `fastify.decorate` method for a given feature module (Fastify plugin)

Conventions for types.
